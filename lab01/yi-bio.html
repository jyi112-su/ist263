        My name is Jana Yi, and I am an Advertising Major with an Emphasis in Creative Art Direction interested in analyzing new methods to engage consumers with visuals and copywriting. This major allows me to utilize my skills in Adobe Creative Cloud as well as learn new understandings of people and their interactions with products. I have been President and Vice President of the Korean American Student Association and Warden and Social Chair for Kappa Phi Lambda Sorority, Inc. Also, I have worked in Greenhouse for the TNH Advertising Agency and S.R. Inter Freight Inc. as a Domestic and International Operations Intern. Lastly, I have been on the Deanâ€™s List for multiple semesters. Outside of work, I love to watch true crime shows as well as read true crime books. I enjoy staying active, lifting, teaching, and snowboarding. I have one older brother who is a year older than me. He lives in Boston while my family lives in California and Korea. Although I love to stay active, I am accident-prone, which does not seem to be a good fit for someone who likes to go outside.
